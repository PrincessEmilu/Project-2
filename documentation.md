# Project 2 Documentation
### Project by Emily Horton and Xander

## Overview
For project 2, we decided to use Star Wars API (SWAPI: https://swapi.co/) to make a webpage for looking up information about Star Wars characters. Our project allows a user to search for a character by name, or browse through random characters, which can be filtered by the film they appeared in. The intent is to introduce people to Star Wars lore that they may be unfamiliar with, as well as to allow the quick lookup of facts for characters they already knew about.

## Our Process

## Workload

## Sources
The background image for our page was taken from: https://pixabay.com/photos/starry-sky-star-galaxies-andromeda-1654074/

We utilized jQuery for the flipping effect of displaying character information.

The SWAPI Documentation can be found here: https://swapi.co/documentation

Our loading graphic was created using loading.io: https://loading.io/

We also referenced Stack Overflow, as well as the Mozilla Developer Network.


## Grade
What grade to we deserve? I'd like to just say 100 and be done with but I don't think that would go over well...
